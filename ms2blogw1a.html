                In social context, we often consider that it's disrespectful to be distracted while talking to other. Your friends may get angry at you for replying to messages while you're have a heart-to-heart talk. Your boss may scold you for checking your phone during a meeting. If you get complained because of your distraction, you might learned to be more focused next time.
            </p>
            


            <h3>Guiding Questions</h3>

            <ul>
                <li> What if our daily objects have this very emotion that they would response to your distraction in its way? Would We get a lesson from that? </li>
            

            </ul>

            <p>Maybe I could endow a series of products with this angry emotion, which may include printer, lamp, mouse, chair, desk, book, phone, mirror. </p>
