            <h3>Guiding Question:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> What if our domestic products have their own needs of socializing?</li>
                <li> What’s our relationship with them? Ownership? Partnership?</li>
                <li> What if these products are labeled according to on their character and social value rather than efficiency and function?</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Concept</h3>
            <p>
                For this prototype, I imagine I adopt a rice cooker who is a social butterfly, but I've been eating alone lately and my rice cooker is pretty upset. He refuses to cook (the switch was becoming difficult to be pulled) until I accept the rice cooker’s invitation to his friend which is a pot in another home.  And
                finally, I have dinner at my home with my rice cooker, my rice cooker’s net friend-a pot and the
                pot’s owner. We have a good time.</p>

            <p>Would products with needs and values change our social behaviors?
            </p>
            <p>Are products domesticating human in this way?
            </p>
<p>What are the criteria for its connection and selection?</p>
